Editing GAP files in Emacs
==========================

(Written February 1993, modified August 1996)

The file "gap-mode.el" provides an Emacs major mode for editing GAP
programs.  Brief installation instructions are given at the end of
this document.

Editing GAP files in Emacs
--------------------------

Opening any file ending in ".g" or ".gap" should automatically put you into
gap-mode, the  major mode for  editing of GAP  code. This mode may  also be
invoked in any buffer at any time by typing M-x gap-mode.

Once in gap-mode there are some notable changes in the  behaviour of Emacs.
Whenever you  press return for a  new line Emacs will reindent  the current
line and auto-indent the new line (this behaviour can  be deactivated).  At
any time, the TAB key  will reindent the  current line, `M-q' will reindent
each line in the current region, and `M-C-q' will reindent each line in the
whole buffer.

Gap-mode will add indentation for if..then structures, function definitions
and all looping structures,

    for N in [1..10] do
        Print ( N );
        if N > 5 then
            Print ( N^2 );
        fi;
    od; ,

as well as indenting continued statements  (those that cross  a line break)
in a number  of different ways. For example,  it  will attempt to  match up
each line of a matrix,

    x := [ [ 1, 2, 3 ],
           [ 4, 5, 6 ],
           [ 7, 8, 9 ] ];

and the arguments of a function call,

    Print ( a, b, c
            d, e, f ); .

There are quite a number of variables that control how gap-mode indentation
behaves. Consult the help for gap-mode by typing `C-h  m' for a list of the
variables (and the features of gap-mode in general), and then `C-h v <var>'
for a description of what the variable <var> controls.


Installation
============

Put the file "gap-mode.el" into a directory in your Emacs lisp load
path.  Add the following lines to your ".emacs" startup file.

----------CUT-HERE----------
;; gap mode
(autoload 'gap-mode "gap-mode" "Gap editing mode" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (append (list '("\\.g$" . gap-mode)
                                    '("\\.gap$" . gap-mode))
                              auto-mode-alist))
----------CUT-HERE----------

That should complete the installation!

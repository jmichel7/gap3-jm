GLISSANDO is a GAP package consisting of libraries of small semigoups
(orders 1 - 5) and near-rings (orders 2 - 15) and functions for
examining them.

The GLISSANDO files are supposed to reside in the 'pkg/gliss/' subirectory
of your GAP installation. That is, move the file 'gliss.tgz' into your 
'gap3r4p3/pkg/' directory and gunzip and untar it.

The package is entirely written in GAP. It requires no extra installation
procedure and can be activated just by 

RequirePackage( "gliss" );

within GAP.

Here is an overview over the files:
'gliss/init.g'  this is the file that initializes the package
'gliss/README'  this file

'gliss/data/'   this is the subdirectory that contains the semigroup
                and near-ring library data

'gliss/doc/'    this directory contains the manual LaTeX file 'gliss.tex'
                and 'gliss.bib' intended for including into the
                GAP 'manual.tex' file: move 'gliss.tex' and 'gliss.bib'
                into GAP's 'doc/' directory (or in 'doc/' just create 
                links to these files) and in 'doc/manual.tex', add 
                '\Include{gliss}' to the long list of '\Include' commands
                and change the '\bibliography{manual}' line to
                '\bibliography{manual,gliss}'. Then 
                'latex manual; bibtex manual; makeindex manual; 
                latex manual; latex manual'.  

                and the additional file 'overview.dvi' that describes
                the theory and algorithms that were used for the 
                computation of the library files.

'gliss/lib/'    this directory contains the files that contain the
                GAP functions for accessing the libraries.
                    
                The files 'csg.g' and 'cnr.g' contain the semigroups and
                near-rings library creation functions. They are not
                part of the package but are left there for documentation
                purposes.

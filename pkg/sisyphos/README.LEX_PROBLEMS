If you do not have GNU 'flex' on your machine, stndard 'lex' is used to
process the file 'sisscan.l'. In this case it is likely that you get errors
which will break the compilation. The SISYPHOS distribution contains
preprocessed versions of 'sisscan.l' and 'sisgram.y' that can be used if you
encounter this problem. Just say 'make no-flex' instead of 'make'.

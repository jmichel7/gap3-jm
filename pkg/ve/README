Welcome to version 3 of my vector enumeration software!

This software is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License, either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER

Please let me know if you install and use these programs.

If you publish results proved using them please include a reference to
one or both of the papers cited in the manual.


The full documentation is in docs/nme.txi in TeXInfo format. In
particular full installation instructions are in there.
You will need version 2.16 of the TeXInfo package and eithe GNU emacs
or TeX to read them.

This package produces three programs:

me   - vector enumeration over prime fields of order less than 256
qme  - vector enumeration over the rational numbers
zme  - vector enumeration over the integers

To use qme or zme you will need to obtain and install version 1.2.99
or later of the GNU multi-precision integer software GMP. The current
version of GMP can be obtained by anonymous FTP from sics.se.

Two styles of installation are possible:

a) simple installation uses a shell script to compile all the programs
  for the current architecture. This should suffice for most users.

b) complex installation uses a makefile which exploits special
features of GNU make version 3.63 or later. This allows the program to
be built for multiple hardware architectures, and is suitable for developers.

Full instructions for both styles of installation are in the manual.

Brief instructions for a simple installation are as follows:

1) edit the file build.sh in this directorty to
   a) Select a C compiler and appropriate flags.
   b) Ensure that the compiler will find the include files
      and libraries for GMP
   c) Include the C alloca if your system does not provide one
   d) Comment out the appropriate sections of the file if you only
      want some of the programs

2) run ./build.sh

You should then have three programs bin/me, bin/qme and bin/zme
ready for use.

=================================================================

The MeatAxe is now written in ANSI C
The documentation is now written in LaTeX2e
Support GAP group library format for matrices
Improved random number generator
New program: ztm (tensor multiply)
Better peakword algorithm (uses polynomials)
Memory-optimized matrix functions (matXXX_(), matXXX__())
chop algorithm: some minor improvements
mkgraph: coloured output, level numbering
zcv: integer matrices, support multiple objects in one file
zsp: -t option
Better algorithm for locating maketab (uses MTXBIN).

Version 2.2.1
-------------
A bug in the matrix addition code has been fixed.

Version 2.2.2

AUTHORS AND COPYRIGHT
=================================================================

Most of the programs in this package are a re-write of Richard
Parker's FORTRAN programs. The C programs were written by Michael
Ringe with many contributions by Klaus Lux and Juergen Mueller.
The original version of the ZZZ module was written by Klaus Lux,
and the maketab program was developped by Marco van Meegen.

The MeatAxe is free software. You may use, copy and distribute it

PACKAGE OVERVIEW
=================================================================

Directory	Contents
----------	--------------------------------------------
src/		All C source (.c) and header (.h) files
bin/		Executable programs. This directory is empty
		in the distribution, except for the Makefile.
bin/proggy/	Some shell scripts to simplify the use of
		the MeatAxe programs.
lib/		The library directory, containing some group
		generators in text form (*.1, *.2) and ZEV
		input files (polyXX, cyclo).
doc/		Documentation in LaTeX form.
tests/		Files for testing the programs (see below).



=================================================================
HOW TO INSTALL THE C MEAT-AXE ON A UNIX MACHINE
=================================================================

1) Change to the `bin' directory, edit the Makefile, and follow
   the instructions.

2) From the `bin' directory, run

	make

   to compile all programs. If your make has problems with
   the Makefile, use gmake (GNU Make).

3) Change to the `tests' directory and run

	./testmtx

   This script should run without any error. It tests various
   programs using GF(2), GF(5), GF(25), and GF(256). You may
   also test the lattice package separately by typing

	./testmtx lattice

4) To print the manual, change to the `doc' directory, run the
   file `meataxe.tex' through LaTeX and print it.

5) Modify your .profile (Bourne shell) or .cshrc (C shell)
   to include `bin' and `bin/proggy' in your PATH.

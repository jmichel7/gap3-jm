                      TODO: XGAP for X-Windows
                      ========================

001) selfile.c:
     A double click on an entry in the file selector should open this
     file.

002) selfile.c:
     The file selector doesn't set the initial filename correctly, for
     example, if one reads a "tst/font.g" and then selects "save as
     postscript" the filename will be "tst/font.g".  It should be the
     empty string.

003) TextSelector:
     Cursor should be changed into a watch if GAP is busy.

004) TextSelector:
     A text selector should listen to WmDeleteWindow messages from
     the window manager.

005) GraphicSheet:
     Menus should be disabled if GAP is busy

006) Hypertex document

007) GraphicSheet:
     Allow to place the title in the window title (some window manager
     allow for long enough titles).

008) xcmds.c
     A disc or circle with radius < 1 might crash X windows,  there
     should be a check in xcmds.c.

009) xgap.c
     The commands produced by XGAP should not be visisble.

010) XGAP Talk Window
     should keep the input focus.

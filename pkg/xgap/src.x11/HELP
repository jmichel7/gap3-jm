Use 'make <company>-<processor>-<os>-<compiler> [flags]' to compile XGAP.

Use 'make machines' to get a list of supported machines. If you are using a
SUN, make sure that you *don't* link the OpenWindows libraries into XGAP,
use static linking if in doubt.  You can use 'COPTS' and 'LOPTS' in order
to pass additional compiler/linker options to cc or gcc.

If the X11 include files directory doesn't live in \"${X11INC}\", you must
set 'X11INC' to point to the correct directory.  If the X11 library files
don't live in \"${X11LIB}\", you must set 'X11LIB' to point to the correct
directory.

For example, in order to compile XGAP on a SUN running SunOS using GCC,
where the X11R5 libraries live in \"/usr/X11R5/lib\" and in order to link
XGAP statically, use

    make sun-sparc-sunos-gcc X11LIB=/usr/X11R5/lib LOPTS=-static

See "xgap/doc.x11/*" for more information.

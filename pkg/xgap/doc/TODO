                          TODO: XGAP Library
                          ==================

001) There should be a depth for graphic object in order to allow overlapping
     objects of different color.

002) GraphicSheet:
     There should be a "Save LaTeX" function (might at least for epic,
     eepic or psfig).

003) InteractiveLattice:
     Inserting a new vertex and making new connection is less than
     optimal.  There should be better ways to do it.

004) GraphicLattice, InteractiveLattice:
     There should be a save function to save the lattice as GAP object
     and read it back in later.

005) GraphicSheet:
     Create color postscript output instead of monochrome output.

006) Relabel:
     'Relabel' for lines with line width > 1 doesn't work.

007) InteractiveLattive (FpGroup):
     There should be a monomial action in the interactive lattice for
     finitely presented groups.

008) --FIXED--
     InteractiveLattive (FpGroup):
     The 'Epimorphisms' text selector should supply projective linear
     groups.

009) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     'DeleteVertex' for finitely presented groups is less than optimal.

010) InteractiveLattice:
     There is no 'DeleteVertex' at all for groups which are not finitely
     presented.

011) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     The Y-position for large quotients in finitely presented groups is
     very bad. 

012) InteractiveLattice:
     A warning should be given if 'InteractiveLattice' hasn't checked
     two groups for conjugacy or equality.

013) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     The NQ should be available in 'InteractiveLattice' for finitely
     presented groups.

014) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     'Select' should be available in 'InteractiveLattice' for finitely
     presented groups.

015) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     There should be merge classes option in 'InteractiveLattice' for
     finitely presented groups.

016) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     The option 'AllOverGroups' in 'InteractiveLattice' for finitely
     presented groups should not test for equality among the groups
     computed.

017) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     The option 'AllOverGroups' in 'InteractiveLattice' for finitely
     presented groups should be applicable to ranges where the top group
     is not the whole group.

018) GraphicLattice & InteractiveLattice:
     'Core', 'Normalizer', 'Centralizer' should be able to compute the
     core, normalizer, centralizer relative to any subgroup.

019) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     Add an exponent to 'DerivedSubgroup' & 'DerivedSeries'.

020) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     There should be a way to use 'TzGoGo', but this requires changes
     to tietze transformation package in order to keep track of the
     schreier information.

021) GraphicLattice:
     'Closure' and 'Intersection' are stupid, they should use 'maximals'
     to compute the closure and intersection instead of calling
     the GAP functions 'Closure' and 'Intersection'.

022) GraphicSheet:
     Create hooks for "save", "save as" and maybe "load" or "restore".

023) GraphicLattice & InteractiveLattice:
     The functions for (not finitely presented) group should set the result
     of an information menu query (like InteractiveLattice for finitely
     presented groups).

024) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     'Cores' should *not* compute a coset table but perm group action.

025) InteractiveLattice:
     There should be a menu entry "Check Conjugacy" analog to
     "Check Coset Table".

026) InteractiveLattice (FpGroup):
     'All Over Groups', 'Conjugacy Class', 'Epimorphisms' and 'Intersection'
     don't print there result in the GAP window.

027) GraphicSheet:
     The font selection for <save as postscript> doesn't work correctly,
     some fonts are too small.  Maybe a postscript guru can fix this.

028) Graphical Lattices:
     There should be support for Hasse diagrams of any kind of lattices.

029) There should be a 'GraphicLattice' and 'InteractiveLattice'
     for modules.

030) There should be a 'GraphicLattice' and 'InteractiveLattice'
     for TOMs.

CHANGES from 2.3 to 2.4:
------------------------

Specht 2.4 is closer to a patch than an update of Specht 2.3;
however, it is more convenient to make it a new release. The
changes from version 2.3 to 2.4 are as follows:

1. New functions:
  - NormalNodes(e|H, mu)
      returns a list of the normal nodes for <mu>.
  - MullineuxSymbol(e|H, mu)
      returns the Mullineux symbol for <mu>.
  - PartitionMullineuxSymbol(e|H, ms)
      returns the partition corresponding to the Mullineux symbol <ms>.
  - BetaSet(mu)
      returns a *set* of beta numbers for <mu>.
  - PartitionBetaSet(bs)
      returns the partition corresponding to the beta set <bs>.
  - ShapeTableau(tab)
      returns the shape (i.e. a partition or composition) for the
      tableau <tab>
  - TypeTableau(tab)
      returns the type of the tableau <tab>
Full details can be found in the manual.

2. The manual and its html analogue have been updated (and the HTML 
improved).

3. Bug fixes:
  - SemiStandardTableau(): previously did not always work. 
  - H.valuation(): the natural valuation for symmetric groups in positive 
      characteristic is now used.
  - H.D(): in 2.3 the multiplicity of Sq(<mu>) in H.D( H.Sq(mu) )
      was 2 (rather than 1); this has been fixed.
  - the decomposition matrix for S_15 over a field of characteristic
    7 is now included (as was previously advertised).
  - in init.g SPECHTHOME is set equal to LOADED_PACKAGES.specht making
    installation virtually automatic (now called SPECHT.Home).

INSTALLATION:

If these files are unpacked into GAP's top directory nothing more needs 
to be done; otherwise follow the instructs in the README file of the
distribution.

To install this package for using with GAP, simply type

  make

The default C compiler is gcc, and the default compiler option is -O2.
To change these, type, for example:

  make CC=cc CFLAGS=-g

You can tidyup by typing

  make clean

The executable programs are put into a directory in the directory 'bin',
with name equal to the hostname of the machine.

The GAP interface files are 'init.g' and the files in the directory 'gap'.
To exercise the interface and the external programs,
go into the directory 'gap', call GAP and type

   ReadTest( "cohomolo.tst" );

The GAP prompt should appear after some time, without any messages.

When you run GAP and wish to use the cohomology functions, call

  RequirePackage( "cohomolo" );

Documentation (in the form of a GAP manual chapter) is in the directory
'gapdoc'.  To printout this chapter, go into this directory and type

  latex manual

which will produce the dvi-file for this chapter as manual.dvi.

Some example files to play with are in the directory 'gapdata'.

Please let me know of any problems.

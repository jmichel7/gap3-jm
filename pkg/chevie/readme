Some remarks concerning CHEVIE.

* CHEVIE  is loaded by reading  into GAP the file  init.g. There are mutual
  dependencies  between chevie,  algebra, vkcurve  and specht  so requiring
  chevie will require the other ones.

* The CHEVIE chapters for the manual are in the subdirectory doc.

  The references for the chevie package have to be added to manual.bib
  in gap3-jm/doc

* The  script maketest.rb from gap3-jm/tools,  which runs all examples from
  the manual, can be run in the doc subdirectory. It should run without any
  problems (apart from the examples showing an error) in about 2-3 minutes.

* Whenever  data is changed in tbl/*.g, the file auto.g must be regenerated
  by destroying it an regenerating it by doing make

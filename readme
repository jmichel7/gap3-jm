gap3-jm
-------

This  is a  complete distribution  of GAP3, which can be found at:
  
  http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jean.michel/gap3

containing up-to-date versions of all the GAP3 packages. 

Are included GAP3 binaries for Dos/Windows, Linux x86-32 and x86-64,
and Mac-OSX 32 and 64 bits.

The installation instructions for GAP3 are as follows:

-  change   directory  to   gap3-jm/bin  and   there  edit,  following  the
   instructions in these files:
   either gap.sh (on Linux or Mac-OSX) 
   or gap.cmd (on Windows)
   most  importantly check  GAP_DIR, and  that GAP_PRG  points to the right
   executable.
   -  put gap.sh (renamed  gap3) someplace on  your path, or  make an alias
   gap3  pointing to it (for Mac-OSX it  may be convenient to make an alias
   in .bash_profile).
   - on Windows similarly move gap.cmd somewhere on your path.

-  For  the documentation, you can consult gap3-jm/manual.pdf and/or make a
   bookmark in your browser pointing to gap3-jm/htm/index.html

Using the packages
------------------

The   on-line  help,  the   html  documentation  and   the  manual  include
documentation of the packages. The packages and their status are:

- algebra,  autag, chevie, cryst, dce, gliss, grim, specht, matrix, monoid,
  vkcurve, xmod

     are written in GAP and will work in any environment.

- arep, guava 
     have some functionality which depends on the binaries distributed

- anupq, anusq, cohomolo, grape, kbmag, nq, meataxe, pcqa, sisyphos, ve
     have most of their functionality depending on the binaries

- xgap 
     has not yet been made to work in this distribution.

The  distributed package binaries  are compiled for  Linux x86. If you have
another system, you may try to build the packages by the following steps:

   cd gap3-jm/pkg
   make cleanpackages
   make packages

Rebuilding the executable or the documentation
----------------------------------------------

Changing  directory to gap3-jm/src and typing "make" will show you possible
targets.  For  instance  "make  clean;make  linux"  will  rebuild the linux
executable.

Changing  directory  to  gap3-jm/doc and  typing  "make"  will  rebuild the
documentation.

If you want the very latest nightly version (at your risk)
---------------------------------------------------------

gap3-jm is now developed on git, you can:
  git clone https://github.com/jmichel7/gap3-jm
this  will  make  a  directory  gap3-jm.  For  further  updates, go to this
directory and do
  git pull
